    <h5>A brief Story of me</h5>
    <p>Hello, My name is Evan J. Raker I was born on december 18, 2002 close to midnight at 11:57.
      My whole life I have lived in Iowa, First in <i>Cedar Rapids</i> and now in <i>Davenport</i>
      and it has been that way for the past five years. I live with my Mother, Father ,and Brother
       along with two dogs and a cat. As a person I have little interests and have been told before
     that I seem most lively when on the topics of Video games and Robotics.</p>
     <h5>Why I joined this class</h5>
     <p>Throughout this whole time and still presently
  I have taken an interest in the field of engineering both with software and hardware.
Respectively in my freshmen year I took both IED (Intro to Engineering Design) and Fundamentals of Web Design.
This course of study is to be continued throughout my whole High School education.</p>
